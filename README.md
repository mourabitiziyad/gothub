# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

The website is a simple responsive app that allows you to search for users on GitHub and display a set of information about them including their repositories, followers, contributions, etc.

The app builds on good foundations for performance and optimizations, including API caching, input debouncing, and server-side rendering.

### Tech stack

- Next.js 14 `/App` Router
- Shadcn UI
- Tailwind CSS
- tRPC + React Query
- Octokit GraphQL API

## How to run

_Preferred_:
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
or 

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
or 

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

## 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
